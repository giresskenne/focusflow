# Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** November 10, 2025  

At **FocusFlow Pro**, protecting your privacy is central to our mission of helping you reclaim focus. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, store, and share your personal information. By using the app, you agree to these practices.

---

## 1. Who We Are

FocusFlow Pro is operated from Ontario, Canada by a private founder‑led company. You can contact us anytime at **support@focusflow.cc** for questions about your data.

---

## 2. Information We Collect

We only collect information necessary to provide and improve the Services.

### 2.1 Information You Provide
- **Account Data:** Email address, password (securely hashed), optional name or preferences.  
- **Focus Sessions:** Duration, apps blocked, completion status, and notes.  
- **Reminders:** Reminder text and schedule preferences.  
- **Support Messages:** Emails, bug reports, or feedback you send us.  

### 2.2 Automatically Collected Information
- Device model, OS version, and app build number  
- Crash reports and diagnostic logs  
- Aggregate usage statistics (e.g., total focus time)  
- General location (country or region only)  

### 2.3 Voice and AI Features
When you use the AI voice assistant feature:
- **Voice Commands:** We collect and process your voice input to recognize commands (e.g., "start a focus session"). Voice data is processed locally on your device whenever possible.  
- **Cloud Processing:** For complex commands, audio may be sent securely to OpenAI's API for intent parsing. OpenAI processes this data according to their privacy policy and does not store voice recordings.  
- **Speech Recognition:** We use iOS speech recognition services to convert voice to text. This follows Apple's privacy standards.  
- **Hybrid Processing:** Approximately 95% of voice commands are handled locally on your device. Only complex or ambiguous commands require cloud processing.

### 2.4 App Blocking and Screen Time
To provide unbreakable focus sessions:
- **iOS Family Controls:** We access which apps you select to block during sessions using Apple's Screen Time API.  
- **App Usage Monitoring:** We monitor blocked app launch attempts only during active sessions to maintain focus integrity.  
- **No Personal Monitoring:** We do not track your overall app usage outside of active focus sessions.  

We do not collect contact lists, photos, precise GPS information, or general microphone recordings outside of voice commands.

### 2.5 Third‑Party Sources
If you sign in through a third‑party platform or make a purchase, we may receive limited data from those providers such as transaction status or user identifier.

## 4. Data Sharing and Disclosure

We share data only with trusted partners who help us operate FocusFlow Pro, such as:

We may also share information if required by law or to protect rights, safety, or property. If FocusFlow Pro is ever merged or sold, your data may transfer under equivalent privacy commitments.

## 5. Cookies and Tracking

FocusFlow Pro uses local storage and analytics identifiers to remember preferences and understand app performance. You can disable analytics in settings or limit tracking through your device permissions.

We apply industry‑standard security measures:
- Encryption (TLS for transit, AES‑256 for storage)  
- Secure authentication and session tokens  
- Voice data encrypted during transmission to OpenAI  
- Limited internal access based on role and need  

Despite our efforts, no system is 100 percent secure. If a data breach occurs, we will notify affected users promptly and take remedial steps.

## 7. Data Retention

We keep your information for as long as your account is active. Backups are kept for 30 days for disaster recovery. When you delete your account, we erase personal data within 30 days unless law requires longer retention.

**Voice Data:** Voice recordings are processed in real‑time and are not stored on our servers. When sent to OpenAI, they are deleted immediately after processing.
