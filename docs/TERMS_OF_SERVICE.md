## 1. Overview

These Terms apply to all users, whether using the free or premium versions.

## 2. Acceptance of Terms and Updates

When you use FocusFlow Pro, you agree to comply with these Terms and all applicable laws. We may revise or update these Terms occasionally. Any significant changes will be communicated in‑app or by email at least 30 days before they take effect. Continued use after such notice constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms.

You must be at least 13 years old (or the age of digital consent in your jurisdiction) to use FocusFlow Pro. By using the Services, you represent that you meet this requirement and have the legal capacity to enter into this agreement.

---

## 4. License to Use the App

We grant you a limited, non‑exclusive, non‑transferable, revocable license to install and use FocusFlow Pro on your personal device for your own non‑commercial use. This license does not grant ownership of the app or its content. All rights not expressly granted remain with FocusFlow Pro.

You agree not to:
- Reverse engineer, decompile, or attempt to derive the source code;

- Circumvent any security or access control systems;

## 9. Unbreakable Focus Sessions

### 9.1 How It Works
FocusFlow Pro uses Apple's Screen Time API to enforce unbreakable focus sessions. When you start a session, selected apps will be blocked until the session ends.

### 9.2 Important Warnings
- **Sessions cannot be cancelled** once started without deleting the app entirely.
- **Emergency access** is limited. Plan accordingly before starting sessions.
- **iOS restrictions** mean that blocked apps cannot be accessed even if you restart your device.
- You are responsible for selecting appropriate session durations and blocked apps.

### 9.3 User Responsibility
By using unbreakable sessions, you acknowledge:
- You understand the commitment required before starting a session.
- You will not hold FocusFlow Pro liable for any consequences of being unable to access blocked apps during active sessions.
- You accept that the feature is designed to be challenging and restrictive by nature.

### 9.4 Limitations
While we strive for reliability, iOS system limitations or device settings may occasionally affect blocking effectiveness. We cannot guarantee 100% blocking in all scenarios.

---

## 10. AI Voice Assistant

### 10.1 Feature Description
The AI voice assistant allows hands‑free control through spoken commands. Voice processing uses a hybrid approach: most commands are handled locally on your device, while complex commands may be sent to OpenAI for processing.

### 10.2 Accuracy and Limitations
- Voice recognition accuracy may vary based on accent, background noise, or speech clarity.
- The AI may occasionally misinterpret commands. Always verify important actions.
- Voice features require microphone permission and active internet connection for cloud processing.

### 10.3 Third‑Party AI Services
Voice commands may be processed by OpenAI. By using voice features, you acknowledge that:
- Audio data may be transmitted to OpenAI for intent parsing.
- OpenAI processes data according to their privacy policy and enterprise agreements.
- Voice recordings are not stored after processing.

### 10.4 No Liability for Misinterpretation
We are not liable for consequences resulting from misinterpreted voice commands or AI errors. You retain full responsibility for actions taken through voice commands.

---

## 11. Privacy and Data Handling

Your data is handled in accordance with our [Privacy Policy](privacy). By using FocusFlow Pro, you consent to our collection and processing of information as described there. We take privacy seriously and minimize the data we store.

**Voice Data:** When using voice features, you consent to voice data processing as outlined in the Privacy Policy. You can disable voice features at any time in app settings.

---

## 12. Service Availability

We aim for continuous availability but cannot guarantee uninterrupted access. Maintenance, updates, or external issues may occasionally cause downtime. We strive to provide notice of planned outages when possible.

We are not liable for losses resulting from temporary unavailability, except where required by law.

---

## 13. Third‑Party Services

FocusFlow Pro integrates with third‑party services including:
- **Apple Screen Time API** for app blocking
- **OpenAI** for voice command processing
- **Supabase** for cloud sync
- **RevenueCat** for subscription management
- Analytics providers and payment processors

These third parties operate under their own terms and privacy policies, which we do not control. We are not responsible for third‑party services or content.

---

## 14. Disclaimers

The app is provided "as is" and "as available." We make no warranties of any kind, express or implied, including warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non‑infringement. We do not guarantee that the Services will always be secure, error‑free, or that app blocking will be 100% effective.

**Voice Features:** We do not warrant that voice recognition will be accurate or error‑free. Voice commands may be misinterpreted.

**Blocking Features:** While designed to be unbreakable, iOS system limitations or user device configurations may affect blocking effectiveness.

---

## 15. Limitation of Liability

To the fullest extent permitted by law, FocusFlow Pro, its affiliates, and contributors shall not be liable for indirect, incidental, or consequential damages, loss of data, profits, or goodwill arising from:
- Use of the Services
- Inability to access blocked apps during sessions
- Misinterpreted voice commands
- Third‑party service failures
- Data loss or synchronization issues

Our total liability for any claim shall not exceed the amount you paid to FocusFlow Pro in the 12 months preceding the event giving rise to the claim.

These limits do not apply to liability that cannot be excluded under applicable law, including personal injury or fraud.

## 16. Indemnification

You agree to indemnify and hold harmless FocusFlow Pro and its team members against any claims, damages, or expenses (including reasonable legal fees) arising from:
- Your misuse of the Services
- Violation of these Terms
- Consequences of being unable to access apps during unbreakable sessions
- Your voice commands or content

---

## 17. Suspension and Termination

We may suspend or terminate your access if you breach these Terms or use the Services unlawfully. You may also terminate at any time by deleting your account. Upon termination, your license to use the app ends, and your data will be deleted per our Privacy Policy.

**Note:** Deleting the app during an active unbreakable session may be required to regain access to blocked apps, but will result in loss of session data.

---

## 18. Changes to the Services

We may modify, add, or remove features at any time to improve functionality or comply with platform rules. If we discontinue a major feature or the app itself, we'll give at least 30 days' notice and, where applicable, provide a prorated refund for prepaid subscriptions.

---

## 19. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution

These Terms are governed by the laws of Ontario, Canada, except where otherwise required by local law.

Before taking formal action, please contact **support@focusflow.cc** so we can try to resolve the issue informally. If a dispute cannot be settled amicably, it will be handled by the courts of Ontario, Canada, unless otherwise required by mandatory law.

---

## 20. Severability

If any provision of these Terms is found invalid or unenforceable, that provision shall be limited or removed to the minimum extent necessary, and the remainder shall remain in full effect.

---
