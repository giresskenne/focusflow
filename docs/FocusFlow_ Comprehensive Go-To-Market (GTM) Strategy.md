Hi [Name],

I'm [Your Name], and I just built FocusFlow, an iOS app that helps people achieve unbreakable focus by blocking distracting apps.

Unlike other app blockers, FocusFlow uses iOS's Screen Time API to make blocking technically impossible to bypass—no Settings access, no date/time tricks, no app uninstall.

I think your [newsletter/blog/podcast] audience would love this. [Readers are interested in productivity / digital wellness / indie apps].

I'm launching in [date], and I'd love to feature this with you. Happy to provide exclusive access, a story, or an interview.

## Part 7: What NOT to Do

### 7.1 Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Don't Spend Money on Paid Ads Too Early**
   - Organic growth is more sustainable
   - Only use paid ads after validating product-market fit
   - Start with $500-1,000 maximum

2. **Don't Ignore User Feedback**
   - Every review and comment is valuable
   - Respond to every review (positive and negative)
   - Implement high-impact feedback quickly

3. **Don't Disappear After Launch**
   - Maintain presence in communities
   - Continue posting content
   - Keep building relationships

4. **Don't Over-Promote**
   - Reddit and HN users hate self-promotion
   - Focus on providing value first
   - Mention your app only when relevant

5. **Don't Neglect SEO & ASO**
   - These are long-term growth channels
   - Optimize early and often
   - Track keyword rankings

6. **Don't Burn Out**
   - Pace yourself over 3 months
   - 25-30 hours per week is sustainable
   - Take breaks and celebrate wins

### 7.2 What Works (Based on Research)

✓ **Organic growth** through communities (Reddit, HN, Product Hunt)  
✓ **Authentic engagement** in communities (answer questions, provide value)  
✓ **Content marketing** (blog posts, Twitter threads)  
✓ **Email list building** (capture emails early)  
✓ **Beta testing** (get feedback and testimonials)  
✓ **Consistent presence** (daily engagement)  
✓ **Word-of-mouth** (build a community that advocates)  
✓ **App Store Optimization** (long-term organic growth)
